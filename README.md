### Exercise 1: Data Preparation and Choosing a Classifier
1. **Copy the Text:** Highlight and copy the entire block of text above.
2. **Open a Text Editor:** Use a text editor like Notepad (Windows), TextEdit (Mac), or VS Code.
3. **Paste and Save:** Paste the copied text into the editor and save the file as `lab.md`. Ensure the file extension is `.md` (e.g., `lab.md` not `lab.md.txt`).
   - On Windows: Use "Save As" and select "All Files (*.*)" as the file type, then name it `lab.md`.
   - On Mac: Save as plain text and ensure the extension is `.md`.
4. **Locate the File:** The file will be saved in your chosen directory (e.g., `Documents` or `Desktop`).
5. **Use or Download:** You can now open `lab.md` in a Markdown viewer (e.g., VS Code, Typora) or upload it to a platform like GitHub.

Note: This Markdown file only includes the content up to Exercise 1 as per your request. If you want the full set of exercises included, please let me know, and I can extend it accordingly!
